class=\"panel\">\r\n      <h2>概述</h2>\r\n      <p>与传统的栅格化一样，flex-layout基于[容器] (相当于Bootstrap的row) 和[栅格] (相当于Bootstrap的column) 来布局:</p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>[容器]有两种：\r\n          <p>flex-column: 容器里的[栅格]以横向排列，与传统栅格化的row一样<br>flex-row: 容器里的[栅格]以竖向排列，就像header、content、footer的排列一样</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>通常，只有[栅格]可以直接放在[容器]中，而你的内容应该放在[栅格]里。但这不是必须的，直接把内容放在[容器]里也没问题。</li>\r\n        <li>如果一个[容器]里包含的[栅格]超过24格，多出的部分将另起一行。</li>\r\n        <li>IE的话只兼容IE10+，其他主流浏览器都支持，具体可以看：<a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=flex\" target=\"_blank\">兼容性</a></li>\r\n        <li>Flexbox有主轴，副轴的概念，flex-layout已经封装好了，你不需要懂得flexbox，也无需针对不同轴使用不同的class。<br> 不过，如果你对Flexbox有所了解的话，用起来会更顺手，推荐阮一峰的\r\n          <a href=\"http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2015/07/flex-grammar.html\">Flex 布局教程</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>与Bootstrap等栅格化不同的是：flex-layout不需要container，栅格本身不自带padding。</li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"panel\">\r\n      <h2>优势</h2>\r\n      <p>flex-layout解决了css布局的不少问题，这里所说的大多在下面的Example里可以看到:</p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>应用一个class就可以垂直居中。</li>\r\n        <li>轻松实现多栏同高。</li>\r\n        <li>自动计算间距，实现等宽布局，不需要再计算margin。</li>\r\n        <li>支持自动填充剩余宽度，以往我们需要通过触发BFC来实现。</li>\r\n        <li>支持自动填充剩余高度，比如将footer置于底部。</li>\r\n        <li>随意调整[栅格]顺序，比如让main比sidebar提前渲染出来。</li>\r\n        <li>丰富的对齐方式：上、下、左、右、左上、右上、左下、右下。</li>\r\n
